### v1.0.2 (2024-06-22)

Abstracted out types for the package to a second crate at `instruct-macro-types`! This allows you to use the procedural macro and get information on the types at runtime

### v1.0.1 (2024-06-22)

Published our first version to crates.io! Implementation is closely tied to the `Instructor` package for now with a goal to decouple this moving forward.
